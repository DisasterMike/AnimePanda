# ðŸ“š AnimePanda

AnimePanda is a site that allows a user to find new anime shows to watch and add them to a watchlist. The app utilizes ChatGPT and the MyAnimeList API to find filter recommendations based on the users inputed preferences and previously watched animes.
This app was created for a final project of our full-stack web developer boot camp at Le Wagon Tokyo.

Inspired by Jane Mount's [Bibliophile](https://www.amazon.com/Bibliophile-Illustrated-Miscellany-Jane-Mount/dp/1452167230) and a story my father once told me: "Why do we keep books? ... We keep books because they remind us of the new perspectives and lessons we learned".
